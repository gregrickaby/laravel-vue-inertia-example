# VueCommerceLab

## Project Overview üöÄ

This repository houses an experimental E-commerce dashboard that serves as a practical application for learning and implementing Laravel. I scaffolded this with [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-inertia) and use [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet#installation) for local development.

### Key Features üõ†

-   **CRUD Operations**: Comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for products and customers, showcasing Laravel's robust back-end capabilities.

## Laravel

### Models

Models are located in the `app/Models` directory. Each model has a corresponding factory and seeder in the `database/factories` and `database/seeders` directories.

Models are responsible for managing the data of the application. They receive input from the controller, validate it, then send it to the database.

### Views

This application uses Vue and Inertia, so the views are in the `resources/js/pages` directory and routed via the [web.php](https://github.com/gregrickaby/vue-commerce-lab/blob/main/routes/web.php) file.

Views are responsible for displaying the data to the user. They receive data from the controller, then render it to the browser.

### Controllers

Controllers are located in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory. Each controller has a corresponding test in the `tests/Feature` directory

Controllers are responsible for handling requests and returning responses. They receive input from the user, validate it, then pass it to the model.

### Routes

Routes are located in the `routes` directory. The `web.php` file contains all the routes for the application.

---

## Vue.js

Vue.js files are located in the `resources/js` directory.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure follows standard Laravel conventions, with the addition of a `types` directory for TypeScript interfaces and types, and a `utils` directory for utility and helper functions.

```tree
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css

‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.blade.php
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ welcome.blade.php
```

### Dynamic Routes

Folders with a `{}` around them are dynamic routes. For example, `/Pages/Customers/{customers}/Edit.vue` is a dynamic route that will match any customer ID. The ID is then available in the `Edit.vue` component.

---

## Tests

This application is equipped with both PHPUnit and Vitest for testing. It also leverages Github Actions for continuous integration and testing, and Storybook for developing UI components in isolation.

### PHPUnit

This application is equipped with PHPUnit tests for all models and controllers. PHP tests are located in the `/tests` directory:

```tree
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Feature
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Auth
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthenticationTest.php
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExampleTest.php
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Unit
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExampleTest.php
```

Laravel routes return Inertia responses that depend on the presence of Vue components. Without the built front-end assets, these components won't be available, leading to failures in tests that make requests to these routes. To avoid this, **you must run the development server in the background while running tests**.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run PHPUnit tests with:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Run a specific test with:

```bash
php artisan test --filter=CustomerTest
```

### Vue Component Testing

This application is equipped with both [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (official test runner) and [Vue Test Utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/guide/) (official testing library) for testing Vue components. Tests must be placed next to the component and named `ComponentName.test.ts`:

```tree
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Atoms
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationLogo
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationLogo.stories.ts <-- Storybook
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationLogo.test.ts <-- Test
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationLogo.test.ts.snap <-- Snapshot
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ApplicationLogo.vue <-- Vue Component
```

You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

Vitest will run the tests in watch mode, so you can make changes to the component and see the results in real-time.

#### Writing Component Tests

Component tests are written in TypeScript and use the [Vitest API](https://vitest.dev/api/) for assertions. Here's an example:

```ts
import ApplicationLogo from '@/Components/Atoms/ApplicationLogo/ApplicationLogo.vue'
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest'

/**
 * Define a test suite.
 *
 * @see https://vitest.dev/api/#describe
 */
describe('ApplicationLogo', () => {
    /**
     * Mount the component.
     *
     * @see https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/#mount
     */
    const wrapper = mount(ApplicationLogo)

    /**
     * Assert the component renders.
     *
     * @see https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html
     */
    test('component renders', () => {
        expect(wrapper).toBeTruthy()
    })

    /**
     * Assert the component is a SVG.
     */
    test('component is SVG', () => {
        wrapper.find('svg')
    })

    /**
     * Assert the component matches the snapshot.
     *
     * @see https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tomatchsnapshot
     */
    test('component matches snapshot', () => {
        expect(wrapper.html()).toMatchSnapshot()
    })
})
```
